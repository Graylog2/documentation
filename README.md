# The Graylog Documentation

Note
====

We published the last version of Graylog Documentation before the release of Graylog 4.2. Now, all documentation and help content for Graylog products are available at https://docs.graylog.org/. If you are looking for previous versions of the Graylog documentation, go to: https://archivedocs.graylog.org/

**There will be no further updates to this repository as of October 2021.**

Do you have questions about our documentation? You can no longer post issues in this repository. However, you may place comments or start discussions about documentation here: https://community.graylog.org/c/documentation-campfire/30
