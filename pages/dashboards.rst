Why dashboards matter
=====================

Using dashboards allows you to build pre-defined views on your data to always have everything important
just one click away.

Sometimes it takes domain knowledge to be able to figure out the search queries
to get the correct results for your specific applications. People with the required domain knowledge
can define the search query once and then display the results on a dashboard to share them with co-workers,
managers, or even sales and marketing departments.

This guide will take you through the process of creating dashboards and storing information on them.
At the end you will have a dashboard with automatically updating information that you can share with
anybody or just a subset of people based on permissions.

How to use dashboards
=====================

Creating an empty dashboard
---------------------------

Navigate to the *Dashboards* section using the link in the top menu bar of your Graylog web interface.
The page is listing all dashboards that you are allowed to view. (More on permissions later.) Hit the
*Create dashboard* button to create a new empty dashboard.

The only required information is a *title* and a *description* of the new dashboard. Use a specific
but not too long title so people can easily see what to expect on the dashboard. The description can be
a bit longer and could contain more detailed information about the displayed data or how it is collected.

Hit the *Create* button to create the dashboard. You should now see your new dashboard on the dashboards
overview page. Click on the title of your new dashboard to see it. Next, we will be adding widgets to the
dashboard we have just created.

Adding widgets
--------------

You should have your empty dashboard in front of you. Let's add some widgets! You can add search result
information to dashboards with a couple of clicks. The following search result types can be added to
dashboards:

  * Search result counts
  * Search result histogram charts
  * Statistical values
  * Field value charts
  * Stacked charts
  * Quick values results

You can learn more about the different widget types in :ref:`widget_types`.

Once you can see the results of your search, you will see buttons with the "Add to dashboard" text, that
will allow you to select the dashboard where the widget will be displayed, and configure the widget.

Examples
========

It is strongly recommended to read the getting started guide on basic searches and analysis first. This
will make the following examples more obvious for you.

  * **Top log sources today**

    * Example search: ``*``, timeframe: Last 24 hours
    * Expand the ``source`` field in the sidebar and hit *Quick values*
    * Add quick values to dashboard

  * **Number of exceptions in a given app today**

    * Example search: ``source:myapp AND Exception``, timeframe: Last 24 hours
    * Add search result count to dashboard

  * **Response time chart of a given app**

    * Example search: ``source:myapp2``, any timeframe you want
    * Expand a field representing the response time of requests in the sidebar and hit *Generate chart*
    * Add chart to dashboard

Widgets from streams
====================

You can of course also add widgets from stream search results. Every widget added this way will always
be bound to streams. If you have a stream that contains every SSH login you can just search for everything
(``*``) in that stream and store the result count as *SSH logins* on a dashboard.

Result
======

You should now see widgets on your dashboard. You will learn how to modify the dashboard, and edit widgets
in the next chapter.

.. _widget_types:

Widget types explained
======================
Graylog supports a wide variety of widgets that allow you to quickly visualize data from your logs.
This section intends to give you some information to better understand each widget type, and how they can
help you to see relevant details from the many logs you receive.

Search result counts
--------------------
This kind of widget includes a count of the number of search results for a given search. It can help you to
quickly visualize things like the number of exceptions an application logs, or the number of requests
your site receives.

All search result counts created with a relative time frame can additionally display trend information. The
trend is calculated by comparing the count for the given time frame, with the one resulting from going further
back the same amount of time. For example, to calculate the trend in a search result count with a relative
search of *5 minutes ago*, Graylog will count the messages in the last 5 minutes, and compare that with the
count of the previous 5 minutes.

The quick values information can be represented as a pie chart and/or as a table, so you can choose what is the
best fit for your needs.

Modifying dashboards
====================

You need to *unlock* dashboards to make any changes to them. Hit the "Unlock/Edit" button in the top right
corner of a dashboard to unlock it. You should now see different icons at the bottom of each widget, that
allow you to perform more actions.

Unlocked dashboard widgets explained
------------------------------------

Unlocked dashboard widgets have two buttons that should be pretty self-explanatory.

  * Delete widget
  * Edit widget configuration
  * Change widget size (when you hover over the widget)

Widget cache times
------------------

Widget values are cached in ``graylog-server`` by default. **This means that the cost of value computation
does not grow with every new device or even browser tab displaying a dashboard.** Some widgets might need
to show real-time information (set cache time to 1 second) and some widgets might be updated way less often
(like *Top SSH users this month*, cache time 10 minutes) to save expensive computation resources.

Repositioning widgets
---------------------

Just grab a widget with your mouse in unlocked dashboard mode and move it around. Other widgets should
adopt and re-position intelligently to make place for the widget you are moving. The positions are
automatically saved when dropping a widget.

Resizing widgets
----------------

When hovering over a widget, you will see that a gray arrow appears in its bottom-right corner. You can use that
icon to resize widgets. Their contents will adapt to the new size automatically!

Dashboard permissions
=====================

Graylog users in the *Admin* role are always allowed to view and edit all dashboards. Users in the *Reader* role
are by default not allowed to view or edit **any** dashboard.

.. image:: /images/dashboard/dashboard_permissions.png

Navigate to *System* -> *Roles* and create a new role that grant the permissions you wish. You can then assign
that new role to any users you wish to give dashboard permissions in the *System* -> *Users* page.

You can read more about :doc:`user permissions and roles <users_and_roles>`.

That's it!
----------

Congratulations, you have just gone through the basic principles of Graylog dashboards. Now think about which dashboards
to create. We suggest:

 * Create dashboards for yourself and your team members
 * Create dashboards to share with your manager
 * Create dashboards to share with the CIO of your company

Think about which information you need access to frequently. What information could your manager or CIO be interested in?
Maybe they want to see how the number of exceptions went down or how your team utilized existing hardware better. The
sales team could be interested to see signup rates in realtime and the marketing team will love you for providing
insights into low level KPIs that is just a click away.
