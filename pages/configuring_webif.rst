Configuring and using the web interface
***************************************

When your Graylog instance/cluster is up and running, the next thing you usually want to do is check out our web interface, which offers you great capabilities for searching and analyzing your indexed data and configuring your Graylog environment. Per default you can access it using your browser on ``http://<graylog-server>:9000``.


Overview
========

The Graylog web interface was rewritten in JavaScript for 2.0 to be a client-side single-page browser application. This means its code is running solely in your browser, fetching all data via HTTP(S) from the REST API of your Graylog server. Therefore there is a second HTTP listener which is serving the assets for the web interface (all JavaScript, fonts, images, CSS files) to the clients.

**Both the web interface port (9000 by default) and the REST API port (12900 by default) must be accessible by everyone using the web interface.**


Configuration Options
=====================

If our default settings do not work for you, there is a number of options in the Graylog server configuration file which you can change to influence its behavior:

+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Setting                 | Default                 | Explanation                                                          |
+=========================+=========================+======================================================================+
| ``web_enable``          | true                    | Determines if the web interface endpoint is started or not.          |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_listen_uri``      | http://127.0.0.1:9000/  | Default address the web interface listener binds to.                 |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_endpoint_uri``    | If not set,             | This is the external address of the REST API of the Graylog server.  |
|                         | ``rest_transport_uri``  | Web interface clients need to be able to connect to this for the web |
|                         | will be used.           | interface to work.                                                   |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_enable_cors``     | false                   | Support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for the web interface assets.  |
|                         |                         | Not required, because no REST calls are made to this listener.       |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_enable_gzip``     | true                    | Serve web interface assets using compression.                        |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_enable_tls``      | false                   | Should the web interface serve assets using encryption or not.       |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_tls_cert_file``   | (no default)            | Path to TLS certificate file, if TLS is enabled.                     |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_tls_key_file``    | (no default)            | Path to private key for certificate, used if TLS is enabled.         |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_tls_key_password``| (no default)            | Password for TLS key (if it is encrypted).                           |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``web_thread_pool_size``| 16                      | Number of threads used for web interface listener.                   |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _webif_connecting_to_server:

How does the web interface connects to the Graylog server?
==========================================================

The web interface is fetching all information it is showing from the REST API of the Graylog server. Therefore it needs to connect to it using HTTP(S). There are several ways how you can define which way the web interface connects to the Graylog server:

  - If the HTTP(S) client going to the web interface port sends a ``X-Graylog-Server-URL`` header, which contains a valid URL, then this is overriding everything else.
  - If ``web_endpoint_uri`` is defined in the Graylog configuration file, this is used if the aforementioned header is not set.
  - If both are not defined, ``rest_transport_uri`` is used.


Browser Compatibility
=====================

Writing the web interface as a single-page application is a challenging task. We want to provide the best possible experience to everyone, which often means using modern web technology only available in recent browsers, while keeping a reasonable compatibility with old and less-capable browsers. These browsers are officially supported in Graylog 2.0:

+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+
| Browser           | OS                   | Minimum Version |
+===================+======================+=================+
| Chrome            | Windows, OS X, Linux | 50              |
+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+
| Firefox           | Windows, OS X, Linux | 45 / 38 ESR     |
+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+
| Internet Explorer | Windows              | 11              |
+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+
| Microsoft Edge    | Windows              | 25              |
+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+
| Safari            | OS X                 | 9               |
+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+

Please take into account that you need to enable JavaScript in order to use Graylog web interface.  

.. _ssl_setup:

SSL Setup
=========

We highly recommend securing your Graylog installation using SSL/TLS to make sure that no sensitive data is sent over the wire in plain text. To make this work, you need to do two things:

  - Enable TLS for the Graylog REST API (``rest_enable_tls``)
  - Enable TLS for the web interface endpoint (``web_enable_tls``)

You also need to make sure that you have proper certificates in place, which are valid and trusted by the clients. Not enabling TLS for either one of them will result in a browser error about mixed content and the web interface will cease to work.


Certificate/Key file format
---------------------------

When you are configuring TLS, you need to make sure that your certificate/key files are in the right format, which is X.509 for certificates and PKCS#8 for the private keys. Both must to be stored in PEM format.

Making the web interface work with load balancers/proxies
=========================================================

If you want to run a load balancer/reverse proxy in front of Graylog, you need to make sure that:

  - The REST API port is still accessible for clients
  - The address for the Graylog server's REST API is properly set (as explained in :ref:`webif_connecting_to_server`), so it is resolvable and accessible for any client of the web interface.
  - You are either using only HTTP or only HTTPS (no mixed content) for both the web interface endpoint and the REST API endpoint.
  - If you use SSL, your certificates must be valid and trusted by your clients.

To help you with your specific environment, here are some example configurations for common scenarios:


Using a Layer 3 load balancer (forwarding TCP Ports):
-----------------------------------------------------

For the following example we're assuming that your Graylog server is running on IP 1.2.3.4. Your external IP (the one external clients are using to access the Graylog instance) is 2.3.4.5.

#. Configure your load balancer to forward connections going to ``2.3.4.5:80`` to ``1.2.3.4:9000`` and ``2.3.4.5:12900`` to ``1.2.3.4:12900``.
#. Set ``web_endpoint_uri`` in your Graylog server config to ``http://2.3.4.5:12900``.
#. Start the Graylog server as usual
#. Access the web interface on ``http://2.3.4.5``.
#. Read up on :ref:`ssl_setup`.

NGINX:
------

For the following samples we are assuming that your Graylog instance is running on ``graylog.internal.example.org`` using the default ports of 12900 for the REST API and 9000 for the web interface. SSL is disabled for both. You want to expose the Graylog web interface as ``https://graylog.example.org``. The configuration for TLS certificates, keys and ciphers is omitted from the sample config for brevity's sake.

If you want to use nginx to proxy access to a Graylog server, you have several options:

**REST API and Web Interface on one port (using HTTPS/SSL)**::

  server
  {
    listen      443 ssl spdy;
    server_name graylog.example.org;

    location /
    {
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Graylog-Server-URL https://graylog.example.org/api
        proxy_pass      http://graylog.internal.example.org:9000;
    }

    location /api/
    {
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass      http://graylog.internal.example.org:12900/;
    }
  }


**REST API and web interface on separate ports (using HTTPS/SSL)**::

  server
  {
    listen      443 ssl spdy;
    server_name graylog.example.org;

    location /
    {
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    X-Graylog-Server-URL https://graylog.example.org:129000
        proxy_set_header    Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass      http://graylog.internal.example.org:9000;
    }
  }

  server
  {
    listen      12900 ssl spdy;
    server_name graylog.example.org;

    location /
    {
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass      http://graylog.internal.example.org:12900/;
    }
  }

Apache:
------- 

For the following samples we are assuming that your Graylog instance is running on ``graylog.internal.example.org`` using the default ports of 12900 for the REST API and 9000 for the web interface. Apache is running on the same server as Graylog. SSL is disabled for both. You want to expose the Graylog web interface as ``https://graylog.example.org``. 

**URI Configs in Graylog server conf**::

   rest_listen_uri = http://127.0.0.1:12900/
   web_listen_uri = http://127.0.0.1:9000/
   
   
**REST API and Web Interface on one port (using HTTPS/SSL)**::
   
   Listen 443
   <VirtualHost *:443>
       ServerName graylog.example.org
       #Your SSL config <-- You should change this
       RequestHeader set X-Graylog-Server-URL "https://graylog.example.org/api/"
       <Location />
           ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:9000/
           ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:9000/
       </Location>
       <Location /api/>
           ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:12900/
           ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:12900/
       </Location>
   </VirtualHost>
