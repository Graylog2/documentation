^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``Log Types To Collect``
   - This determines which of the five available log types the Input will pull from Office 365
- ``Polling Interval``
   - This determines how often (in minutes) the Input will check for new log data
   - This value cannot be less than 1 (checking every minute)
- ``Enable Throttling``
   - If selected, this will enable Graylog to stop reading new data for this Input if the system gets behind on message processing and needs to catch up
- ``Store Full Message``
   - If selected, this will cause Graylog to store the raw log data in the ``full_message`` field for each log message
   - Selecting this option can result in a significant increase in the amount of data stored
