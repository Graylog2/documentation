Widgets
---------------------

A widget is either a Message Table or an Aggregation. It can be freely
placed inside a query. A widget can be edited or duplicated by clicking
on the chevron on the right side in the head of the widget.
Next to the chevron is a filter symbol, where filters can be added to the
top search query.

Aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^
The goal of an aggregation is to reduce the number of data points
in a meaningful way to get an answer from them. Data points can be
numeric field types in a message (e.g. a took_ms field which contains how
long a page needed to be rendered).
Or string values which can be used for grouping the aggregation
(e.g an action field which contains the name of the controller action).

Creating an aggregation
"""""""""""""""""""""""
By clicking on `+ Create` -> `Custom Aggreatation` a new empty widget will
be shown on the very top of the Extended Search page.
A click on the chevron icon on the right side of the head will open the widget
in a modal in the edit mode.

:METRICS:
   **METRICS** are a collection of functions to aggregate data points.
   The result of the aggregation depends on the grouping of **ROWS** and/or
   **COLUMNS**. The data points of a field will be aggregated to the grouping.
   *Example* The ``avg()`` function will find the average of the
   numeric data points ``took_ms`` around the configured grouping. 

:ROWS/COLUMNS:
   Allows selecting fields whose values will be used to group results into
   new rows/columns. If the field is a ``timestamp`` for a row it will
   divide the data points into intervals. Otherwise the aggregation will take
   by default up to 15 elements of the selected field and apply the
   selected **METRICS** function to the data points.
   *Example* The ``timestamp`` field is aggregated with ``avg()`` on
   ``took_ms``. The column ``action`` will give the average loading
   time for a page per action for every 5 minutes.

:VISUALIZATION:
   To display the result of an aggregation it is often easier to
   compare lots of result values graphically. ``Bar Chart``,
   ``Data Table``, ``Line Chart``, ``Pie Chart``, ``Scatter Plot``,
   ``Single Number`` or ``World Map`` can be used as **VISUALIZATION**.
   The ``World Map`` needs geographical points in the form of ``latitude,longitude``.

:SORTING/DIRECTION:
   The order of the result values can be configured here. **SORTING** defines
   by which field the sorting should happen and **DIRECTION** configures
   if it will be ``ascending`` or ``descending``.


Message Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Message Table displays the messages and their fields.
The Message Table can be configured to show the message fields and
the actual message. The actual message is rendered in a blue font,
below the fields.
Clicking on a message row opens the detailed view of a message with
all its fields.

Value and Field Actions
"""""""""""""""""""""""
In the Sidebar and on Data Tables and Detail Message Rows are values and
fields visible. By clicking on a value or a field a context menu will be
shown where different actions can be executed.

Field actions
"""""""""""""
Based on the type of the field and where the menu is opened different
Field actions are shown when a field name (and not its value) is clicked.

:Chart:
   This will generate a new Widget containing a line chart where the fields
   average value is displayed over time. This chart can be taken as an
   starting point for a more defined aggregation. This is only possible
   on fields from a numerical type.
:Aggregate:
   This action will generate a new Widget containing a data table
   where the fields value are listed in the rows and the count
   of occurrence will be displayed next to it.
   This was formerly known as the "Quick Values" action.
:Statistics:
   Here the field values will be given to various statistics function
   depending on the type of the field. The result will be displayed
   in a Data Table Widget.
:Add to table:
   Add the field to the displayed fields of the message table where
   the Field Actions menu is shown.
:Add to all tables:
   Add the field to the displayed fields of all tables.
:Remove from table:
   Remove the field from the list displayed fields from this table.
:Remove from table:
   Remove the field from the list displayed fields from all tables.

Value actions
"""""""""""""
The value actions produce different results depending on the type of the
value and where the menu is opened. The following actions can be executed.

   :align: center

:Insert into view:
   This action will open up a modal where a view can be selected.
   A select-able list of Parameters will be shown from the selected
   view and after choosing a parameter a new browser tab will be
   opened containing the view with the value used in the parameter.
   This action is only available in enterprise Graylog.
:Exclude from results:
   Will add `NOT field:value` to the query to exclude all results
   where the field contains the value of the value action.
:Add to query:
   Will add `field:value` to the query to filter the results
   additionally for where the field has the value of the value action.
:Use in new query:
   Will open a new view tab with `field:value` as query string.
:Show documents for value:
   Available in Data Tables it will show the documents which
   where aggregated to display this value.
:Create extractor:
   For values of type string in Message Tables a short cut to create
   an extractor is given with this action.
:Highlight this value:
   This action will highlight this value for this field in all
   Message Tables and Data Tables.
