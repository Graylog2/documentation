Saved Searches
---------------------

Sometimes you may want a specific search configuration to be used later. Graylog provides a saved search functionality to accomplish exactly that.

Once you submitted your search, click on the *Save* button on the right side of the search bar.

Give a name to the current search and click on save. When you want to use the saved search later on, you only need to click on the *Load* button and select it from the list. You can also use the overview to delete a saved search.

Of course, you can always update your saved search. To do so, select it from the overview, change the search, e.g. by adding new fields for a message table, adding new widgets or defining a different search query and click on the *Save* button.
The open dialog allows changing the name and also contains a *Save as* button to create a new saved search without changing the original one.
