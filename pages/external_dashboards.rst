External dashboards

There are other frontends that are connecting to the Graylog REST API and display data or information in a
special way.

CLI stream dashboard
====================

This official Graylog dashboard which is developed by us is showing live information of a specific stream in
your terminal. For example it is the perfect companion during a deployment of your platform: Run it next to
the deployment output and show information of a stream that is catching all errors or exceptions on your
systems.
