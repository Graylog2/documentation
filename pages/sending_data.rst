*******************
Sending in log data
*******************

A Graylog setup is pretty worthless without any data in it. This page explains the basic principles of getting your data
into the system and also explains common fallacies.

What are Graylog message inputs?
================================

Message inputs are the Graylog parts responsible for accepting log messages. They are launched from the web interface
(or the REST API) in the *System -> Inputs* section and are launched and configured without the need to restart any
part of the system.

Content packs
=============

Content packs are bundles of Graylog input, extractor, stream, dashboard, and output configurations that can provide full support
for a data source. Some content packs are shipped with Graylog by default and some are available from the website. Content packs that
were downloaded from `here <https://www.graylog.org/resources/data-sources/>`_ can be imported using the Graylog web interface.

You can load and even create own content packs from the *System -> Content Packs* section of your Graylog web interface.

Syslog
======

Graylog is able to accept and parse `RFC 5424 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5424.txt>`_ and
`RFC 3164 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt>`_  compliant syslog messages and supports TCP transport with both
the octet counting or termination character methods. UDP is also supported and the recommended way to send log messages
in most architectures.

**Many devices, especially routers and firewalls, do not send RFC compliant syslog messages.** This might result
in wrong or completely failing parsing. In that case you might have to go with a combination of *raw/plaintext* message inputs that
do not attempt to do any parsing and :doc:`extractors`.

Rule of thumb is that messages forwarded by ``rsyslog`` or ``syslog-ng`` are usually parsed flawlessly.

Sending syslog from Linux hosts
-------------------------------

rsyslog
^^^^^^^

Forwarding syslog messages with rsyslog is easy. The only important thing to get the most out of your logs is following
`RFC 5424 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5424.txt>`_. The following examples configures your ``rsyslog`` daemon to send
RFC 5424 date to Graylog syslog inputs:

UDP::

  $template GRAYLOGRFC5424,"<%PRI%>%PROTOCOL-VERSION% %TIMESTAMP:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %APP-NAME% %PROCID% %MSGID% %STRUCTURED-DATA% %msg%\n"
  *.* @graylog.example.org:514;GRAYLOGRFC5424

TCP::

  $template GRAYLOGRFC5424,"<%PRI%>%PROTOCOL-VERSION% %TIMESTAMP:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %APP-NAME% %PROCID% %MSGID% %STRUCTURED-DATA% %msg%\n"
  *.* @@graylog.example.org:514;GRAYLOGRFC5424

(The difference between UDP and TCP is using ``@`` instead of ``@@`` as target descriptor.)

Alternatively, the rsyslog built-in template `RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format <http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v5-stable/configuration/templates.html#string-based-templates>`_ sends log messages in the same format as above. This exists in rsyslog versions of at least 5.10 or later.

The UDP examples above becomes::

  *.* @graylog.example.org:514;RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format

syslog-ng
^^^^^^^^^

Configuring syslog-ng to send syslog to Graylog is equally simple. Use the ``syslog`` function to send
`RFC 5424 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5424.txt>`_ formatted syslog messages via TCP to the remote Graylog host::

  # Define TCP syslog destination.
  destination d_net {
      syslog("graylog.example.org" port(514));
  };
  # Tell syslog-ng to send data from source s_src to the newly defined syslog destination.
  log {
      source(s_src); # Defined in the default syslog-ng configuration.
      destination(d_net);
  };

Sending syslog from MacOS X hosts
---------------------------------

Sending log messages from MacOS X syslog daemons is easy. Just define a ``graylog-server`` instance as UDP log target by
adding this line in your ``/etc/syslog.conf``::

  *.* @graylog.example.org:514

Now restart ``syslogd``::

  $ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
  $ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist

**Important:** If ``syslogd`` was running as another user you might end up with multiple ``syslogd`` instances and strange
behaviour of the whole system. Please check that only one ``syslogd`` process is running::

  $ ps aux | grep syslog
  lennart         58775   0.0  0.0  2432768    592 s004  S+    6:10PM   0:00.00 grep syslog
  root            58759   0.0  0.0  2478772   1020   ??  Ss    6:09PM   0:00.01 /usr/sbin/syslogd

That's it! Your MacOS X syslog messages should now appear in your Graylog system.

GELF / Sending from applications
================================

The Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) is a log format that avoids the shortcomings of classic plain syslog and is perfect
to logging from your application layer. It comes with optional compression, chunking and most importantly a clearly defined
structure. There are `dozens of GELF libraries <https://www.graylog.org/resources/data-sources/>`_ for many frameworks and
programming languages to get you started.

Read more about GELF `on graylog.org <https://www.graylog.org/resources/gelf-2/>`_.

GELF via HTTP
-------------

You can send in all GELF types via HTTP, including uncompressed GELF that is just a plain JSON string.

After launching a GELF HTTP input you can use the following endpoints to send messages::

  http://graylog.example.org:[port]/gelf (POST)

Try sending an example message using curl::

  curl -XPOST http://graylog.example.org:12202/gelf -p0 -d '{"short_message":"Hello there", "host":"example.org", "facility":"test", "_foo":"bar"}'

Both keep-alive and compression are supported via the common HTTP headers. The server will return a ``202 Accepted`` when the message
was accepted for processing.


Microsoft Windows
=================

Our recommended way to forward Windows log data (for example EventLog) to Graylog is to use the open source
`nxlog community edition <http://nxlog.org/products/nxlog-community-edition>`_. It comes with a native Graylog GELF
output that nicely structures your log messages.

Heroku
======

Heroku allows you to forward the logs of your application to a custom syslog server by creating a so called
`Syslog drain <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#syslog-drains>`_. The drain sends all logs to the configured
server(s) via TCP. Following example shows you how to configure Graylog to receive the Heroku logs and extract the
different fields into a structured log message.

Creating a Graylog input for Heroku log messages
------------------------------------------------

Create a new **RAW/Plaintext TCP** input as shown below.

.. image:: /images/heroku_1.png

.. image:: /images/heroku_2.png

The Graylog `Extractor library <https://www.graylog.org/resources/data-sources/>`_ contains a set of
`extractors to parse the Heroku log format <https://www.graylog.org/resource/extractor/53795f36e4b0b8f13c3d2ce5/>`_.
You can import that set into the newly created input so all parts of the log messages will be extracted into separate fields:

Open the extractor management for the input.

.. image:: /images/heroku_3.png

Go to the extractor import.

.. image:: /images/heroku_4.png

Paste the extractor JSON string into the form and submit.

.. image:: /images/heroku_5.png

That is all that is needed on the Graylog side. Make sure your firewall setup allows incoming connections on the inputs port!

.. image:: /images/heroku_6.png

Configuring Heroku to send data to your Graylog setup
-----------------------------------------------------

Heroku has a detailed `documentation <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#syslog-drains>`_ regarding the Syslog drains feature.
The following example shows everything that is needed to setup the drain for you application::

  $ cd path/to/your/heroku/app
  $ heroku drains
  No drains for this app
  $ heroku drains:add syslog://graylog.example.com:5556
  Successfully added drain syslog://graylog.example.com:5556
  $ heroku drains
  syslog://graylog.example.com:5556 (d.8cf52d32-7d79-4653-baad-8cb72bb23ee1)

The `Heroku CLI tool <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command>`_ needs to be installed for this to work.

You Heroku application logs should now show up in the search results of your Graylog instance.

Ruby on Rails
=============

This is easy: You just need to combine a few components.

Log all requests and logger calls into Graylog
-----------------------------------------------

The recommended way to send structured information (i.e. HTTP return code, action, controller, ... in additional fields) about every request and
explicit ``Rails.logger`` calls is easily accomplished using the `GELF gem <https://rubygems.org/gems/gelf>`_ and
`lograge <https://github.com/roidrage/lograge>`_. Lograge builds one combined log entry for every request (instead of several lines like the
standard Rails logger) and has a Graylog output since version 0.2.0.

Start by adding Lograge and the GELF gem to your Gemfile::

  gem "gelf"
  gem "lograge"

Now configure both in your Rails application. Usually ``config/environments/production.rb`` is a good place for that::

  config.lograge.enabled = true
  config.lograge.formatter = Lograge::Formatters::Graylog2.new
  config.logger = GELF::Logger.new("graylog.example.org", 12201, "WAN", { :host => "hostname-of-this-app", :facility => "heroku" })

This configuration will also send all explicit ``Rails.logger`` calls (e.g. ``Rails.logger.error "Something went wrong"``) to Graylog.

Log only explicit logger calls into Graylog
-------------------------------------------

If you don't want to log information about every request, but only explicit ``Rails.logger`` calls, it is enough to only configure the Rails logger.

Add the GELF gem to your Gemfile::

  gem "gelf"

...and configure it in your Rails application. Usually ``config/environments/production.rb`` is a good place for that::

  config.logger = GELF::Logger.new("graylog.example.org", 12201, "WAN", { :host => "hostname-of-this-app", :facility => "heroku" })

Heroku
------

You need to apply a workaround if you want custom logging on Heroku. The reason for this is that Heroku injects an own logger (``rails_log_stdout``),
that overwrites your custom one. The workaround is to add a file that makes Heroku think that the logger is already in your application::

    $ touch vendor/plugins/rails_log_stdout/heroku_fix

Raw/Plaintext inputs
====================

The built-in *raw/plaintext* inputs allow you to parse any text that you can send via TCP or UDP. No parsing is applied at
all by default until you build your own parser using custom :doc:`extractors`. This is a good way to support any text-based
logging format.

You can also write :doc:`plugins` if you need extreme flexibility.

JSON path from HTTP API input
=============================

The JSON path from HTTP API input is reading any JSON response of a REST resource and stores a field value of it as a Graylog message.

Example
-------

Let's try to read the download count of a release package stored on GitHub for analysis in Graylog. The call looks like this::

    $ curl -XGET https://api.github.com/repos/YourAccount/YourRepo/releases/assets/12345
    {
      "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/YourAccount/YourRepo/releases/assets/12345",
      "id": 12345,
      "name": "somerelease.tgz",
      "label": "somerelease.tgz",
      "content_type": "application/octet-stream",
      "state": "uploaded",
      "size": 38179285,
      "download_count": 9937,
      "created_at": "2013-09-30T20:05:01Z",
      "updated_at": "2013-09-30T20:05:46Z"
    }

The attribute we want to extract is ``download_count`` so we set the JSON path to ``$.download_count``.

This will result in a message in Graylog looking like this:

.. image:: /images/jsonpath_1.png

You can use Graylog to analyse your download counts now.

JSONPath
--------

JSONPath can do much more than just selecting a simple known field value. You can for example do this to select the first ``download_count``
from a list of releases where the field ``state`` has the value ``uploaded``::

    $.releases[?(@.state == 'uploaded')][0].download_count

...or only the first download count at all::

    $.releases[0].download_count


You can `learn more about JSONPath here <http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/>`_.

Reading from files
==================

Graylog is currently not providing an out-of-the-box way to read log messages from files. We do however recommend two
fantastic tools to do that job for you. Both come with native Graylog (GELF) outputs:

  * `fluentd <http://www.fluentd.org/guides/recipes/graylog2>`_ 
  * `logstash <http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/outputs/gelf>`_

**NOTE:** fluentd doesn't yet support sub-second time resolution which makes searching and
ordering more difficult, see issue `#461 <http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/>`_
