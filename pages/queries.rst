The search page is the heart of the Graylog. You can execute a query and visualize the search result with a variety of widgets. Any search can be saved or exported as dashboard.
Saved searches allow to easily reuse specific search configurations, while dashboards enable widget specific search queries and sharing with other users.
With 3.2 we have rewritten the search interface and unified the layout for the main search, saved searches and dashboards.
