Architectural considerations
****************************

There are a few rules of thumb when scaling resources for Graylog:

* ``graylog-server`` nodes should have a focus on CPU power.
* Elasticsearch nodes should have as much RAM as possible and the fastest disks you can get.
  Everything depends on I/O speed here.
* MongoDB is only being used to store configuration and the dead letter messages, and can be
  sized fairly small.
* ``graylog-web-interface`` nodes are mostly waiting for HTTP answers of the rest of the system
  and can also be rather small.
* ``graylog-radio`` nodes act as workers. They don't know each other and you can shut them down
  at any point in time without changing the cluster state at all.

Also keep in mind that messages are **only** stored in Elasticsearch. If you have data loss on
Elasticsearch, the messages are gone - except if you have created backups of the indices.

MongoDB is only storing meta information and configuration data.

Minimum setup
-------------

This is a minimum Graylog setup that can be used for smaller, non-critical, or test setups.
None of the components is redundant but it is easy and quick to setup.

Bigger production setup
-----------------------

This is a setup for bigger production environments. It has several ``graylog-server`` nodes behind
a load balancer that share the processing load. The load balancer can ping the ``graylog-server``
nodes via REST/HTTP to check if they are alive and take dead nodes out of the cluster.

Highly available setup with Graylog Radio
------------------------------------------

Beginning with Graylog 1.0 on, we no longer recommend running Graylog Radio because we are now using a
high-performant message journal (from the Apache Kafka project) in every `graylog-server` instance which is
spooling all incoming messages to disk immediately and is able to buffer load spikes at least as well as
Graylog Radio was, but with fewer dependencies and maintenance overhead.

If you are running a setup with Graylog Radio we recommend to shut down the Graylog Radio architecture
including AMQP or Kafka brokers completely and directly send messages to the `graylog-server` nodes.
If you have been using Graylog Radio for load balancing, you should now put a classic load balancer in front
of your `graylog-server` nodes.

**This approach has been proven to work great in large high-throughput setups of several of our large scale
customers and immensely reduced complexity of their setups.**

The Kafka and AMQP inputs are still supported and can be used to build a custom setup using message brokers,
if you want to keep using that. A reason for this might be that Graylog is not the only subscriber to the
messages on the bus. However we would recommend to use Graylog forwarders to either write to a message bus
after processing or write to other systems directly.
