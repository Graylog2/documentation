Overview
********

Log View is an aggregation type that presents your log data in a format similar to Common Log Format. 
This particular view is helpful if you seek a raw, unfiltered layout of all system events as if they’re 
stored in a log file. Log View has the look and feel of console output. So you’ll have the ability to 
scroll through log events in real-time.

Of course, this plain format with provide you the ability to sleuth around your log events, in the
following ways:

* record faults to diagnose and debug
* identify security breaches and other system and network misuses.
* auditing

The Log View widget is customizable by column. At creation, timestamp, source, and message are the 
columns presented, in a table chart. At any time, you can add new values, fields, metrics to build 
reports that you need.
