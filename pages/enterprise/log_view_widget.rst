Overview
********

Log View is an aggregation type that presents your log data in a format similar to Common Log Format. 
This particular view is helpful if you seek a raw, unfiltered layout of all system events as if they’re 
stored in a log file. Log View has the look and feel of console output. So you’ll have the ability to 
scroll through log events in real-time. 

The Log View widget is customizable by column. At creation, timestamp, source, and message are the 
columns presented, in a table chart. At any time, you can add new values, fields, metrics to build 
reports that you need. 

To get familiar with Log View this in this guide, perform the following actions.

#. Create a new Log View widget
#. Expand your report with columns and corresponding values to the new widget
#. Focus on the widget with an expanded view
#. Export report details into a format such as NDJSON 

Consider that you may need to gather smaller relationships for such actions as:

* recording faults to diagnose and debug
* identifying security breaches and other system and network misuses.
* auditing

In addition, the Log View aggregation allows you to select a sample of a line, then copy it. 
You can paste the selection to your text editor or a file, with formatting identical to the Log View layout.
