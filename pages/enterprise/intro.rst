Graylog Enterprise, built on top of the Graylog open source platform, offers
additional features that enable users to deploy Graylog at enterprise scale
and apply Graylog to processes and workflows across the whole organization.

When the Graylog enterprise plugins and Graylog enterprise integrations plugin is installed the some additional features are added to Graylog. The following list should give a brief overview what is added to Graylog. All of this will only work with a valid enterprise license.
