Custom Notifications
********************

Custom notifications allow Graylog administrators to share messages with all of their Graylog users.  
Whether you need to notify users of planned downtime or provide a warning message on the log on screen for compliance 
reasons, custom notifications will help you get the message out. This feature is also available in the *Customization* menu.
