Operating System Package Installation

.. _forwarder_os_packages:

The most common installation method is to use the Linux operating system packages. You can choose

In addition, be sure to have access to a TLS certificate and an API token generated from Graylog.

*******************
Docker Installation
*******************

Additionally, your Forwarder is available as a Docker image. Regardless of your installation method, youâ€™re required
to create a digital certificate to ensure better security. The forwarder is also available as a docker image. 
To download the image, run the following command: ``docker pull graylog/graylog-forwarder:<release-version>``.

To run the container, you will need to pass it the following environment variables:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ GRAYLOG_FORWARDER_SERVER_HOSTNAME
        $ GRAYLOG_FORWARDER_GRPC_API_TOKEN

You'll also need to mount the certificate file as a volume. Here is an example command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ docker run -e GRAYLOG_FORWARDER_SERVER_HOSTNAME=ingest.<SERVER NAME> -e GRAYLOG_FORWARDER_GRPC_API_TOKEN=<INSERT_API_TOKEN_HERE> -v /path/to/cert/cert.pem:/etc/graylog/forwarder/cert.pem graylog/graylog-forwarder:<release-version>
