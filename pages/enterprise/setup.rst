Setup
*****

Graylog Enterprise comes as a single package that includes Graylog Server and the following plugins:

- Enterprise plugin
- Integrations plugin
- Enterprise Integrations plugin

If you're already running an open source instance, you can :ref:`install these plugins separately<enterprise-setup-updateoss>` to convert it to an Enterprise instance.


Requirements
============

Graylog Enterprise has the following prerequisites:

* Some modern Linux distribution (Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, or CentOS recommended)
* `Elasticsearch 6.8+ or 7 <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch>`_
* `MongoDB 3.6, 4.0 or 4.2 <https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/install-on-linux/>`_
* Oracle Java SE 8 (OpenJDK 8 also works; latest stable update is recommended)

Installation
============


DEB / APT
---------

For installation on apt-based systems (such as Debian or Ubuntu), run the following commands::

  $ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
  $ wget https://packages.graylog2.org/repo/packages/graylog-4.0-repository_latest.deb
  $ sudo dpkg -i graylog-4.0-repository_latest.deb
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install graylog-enterprise


RPM / YUM / DNF
---------------

For installation on rpm-based systems (such as CentOS or Redhat), run the following commands::

  $ sudo rpm -Uvh https://packages.graylog2.org/repo/packages/graylog-4.0-repository_latest.rpm
  $ sudo yum install graylog-enterprise


Edit the Configuration File
----------------------------

Read the instructions *within* the configuration file and edit as needed. It is located at: ``/etc/graylog/server/server.conf``.  Additionally add ``password_secret`` and ``root_password_sha2`` as these are *mandatory* and **Graylog will not start without them**.

To create your ``root_password_sha2`` run the following command::

    $ echo -n "Enter Password: " && head -1 </dev/stdin | tr -d '\n' | sha256sum | cut -d" " -f1

To be able to connect to Graylog you should set ``http_bind_address`` to the public host name or a public IP address of the machine you can connect to. More information about these settings can be found in :ref:`Configuring the web interface <configuring_webif>`.

.. note:: If you're operating a single-node setup and would like to use HTTPS for the Graylog web interface and the Graylog REST API, it's possible to use :ref:`NGINX or Apache as a reverse proxy <configuring_webif_nginx>`.


Starting Graylog
----------------
Graylog can be started with the following commands. Make sure to use the correct command for your operating system.

======================================== =========== =======================================
OS                                       Init System Command
======================================== =========== =======================================
CentOS 6                                 SysV        ``sudo service graylog-server start``
CentOS 7, 8                              systemd     ``sudo systemctl start graylog-server``
Debian 7                                 SysV        ``sudo service graylog-server start``
Debian 8 & 9, Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04 systemd     ``sudo systemctl start graylog-server``
======================================== =========== =======================================


The packages are configured to **not** start any Graylog services during boot. You can use the following commands to start Graylog when the operating system is booting.

======================================== =========== ==================================================
OS                                       Init System Command
======================================== =========== ==================================================
CentOS 6                                 SysV        ``sudo update-rc.d graylog-server defaults 95 10``
CentOS 7, 8                              systemd     ``sudo systemctl enable graylog-server``
Debian 7                                 SysV        ``sudo update-rc.d graylog-server defaults 95 10``
Debian 8 & 9, Ubuntu 16.06, 18.04, 20.04 systemd     ``sudo systemctl enable graylog-server``
======================================== =========== ==================================================

Cluster Setup
=============

If you run a Graylog cluster you need to add the enterprise plugins to every Graylog node. Additionally your load-balancer must route ``/api/plugins/org.graylog.plugins.archive/`` only to the Graylog master node. Future versions of Graylog will forward these requests automatically to the correct node.


Update Graylog Enterprise
