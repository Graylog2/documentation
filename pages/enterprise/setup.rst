Installation
============

Since Graylog 2.4 the Graylog Enterprise plugins can be installed the same way Graylog is installed. In most setups this will be done with the package tool provided by the distribution you are using and the online repository.

.. note:: For previous versions of Graylog Enterprise please contact your Graylog account manager.

Once you installed the Graylog Enterprise plugins you need to obtain a license from `the Graylog Enterprise web page <https://www.graylog.org/enterprise/>`_. 

Should a simple `apt-get install graylog-enterprise-plugins` or `yum install graylog-enterprise-plugins` not work for you, the following information might help you.

.. important:: The Graylog Enterprise plugins need to be installed on all your Graylog nodes!

DEB / RPM Package
-----------------

The default installation should be done with the system package tools. It includes the repository installation that is described in the :doc:`/pages/installation/operating_system_packages` installation guides. 

When the usage of online repositorys is not possible in your environment, you can download the Graylog Enterprise plugins at `https://packages.graylog2.org <https://packages.graylog2.org>`_. 

.. note:: These packages can **only** be used when you installed Graylog via the :doc:`/pages/installation/operating_system_packages`!

DEB
~~~

The installation on distributions like Debian or Ubuntu can be done with *apt-get* as installation tool from the previous installed online repository.  

::
  
  $ sudo apt-get install graylog-enterprise-plugins


RPM
~~~

The installation on distributions like CentOS or RedHat can be done with *yum* as installation tool from the previous installed online repository.

::
  
  $ sudo yum install graylog-enterprise-plugins


Tarball
-------

If you have done a manual installation or want to include only parts of the enterprise plugins you can get the tarball from the download locations listed in the following table.

.. list-table:: Enterprise Plugins download
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Enterprise Version
      - Download URL
    * - 2.4.0
      - :enterprise-plugins-tar:`2.4.0`
    * - 2.4.1
      - :enterprise-plugins-tar:`2.4.1`
    * - 2.4.2
      - :enterprise-plugins-tar:`2.4.2`
    * - 2.4.3
      - :enterprise-plugins-tar:`2.4.3`


The tarball includes the enterprise plugin JAR files.

::

  $ tar -tzf graylog-enterprise-plugins-2.4.0.tgz
    graylog-enterprise-plugins-2.4.0/LICENSE
    graylog-enterprise-plugins-2.4.0/plugin/graylog-plugin-archive-2.4.0.jar
    graylog-enterprise-plugins-2.4.0/plugin/graylog-plugin-auditlog-2.4.0.jar
    graylog-enterprise-plugins-2.4.0/plugin/graylog-plugin-license-2.4.0.jar

Depending on the Graylog setup method you have used, you have to install the plugins into different locations.

.. include:: /includes/plugin-installation-locations.rst

Also check the ``plugin_dir`` config option in your Graylog server configuration file. The default might have been changed.

Make sure to install the enterprise plugin JAR files alongside the other Graylog plugins.
Your plugin directory should look similar to this after installing the enterprise plugins.

Server Restart
==============

After you installed the Graylog Enterprise plugins you have to restart each of your Graylog servers
to load the plugins.

.. note:: We recommend restarting one server at a time!

You should see something like the following in your Graylog server logs. It indicates that the plugins have been successfully loaded.

Cluster Setup
=============

If you run a Graylog cluster you need to add the enterprise plugins to every Graylog node. Additionally your load-balancer must route ``/api/plugins/org.graylog.plugins.archive/`` only to the Graylog master node. Future versions of Graylog will forward these requests automatically to the correct node.


License Installation
====================

The Graylog Enterprise plugins require a valid license to use the additional features.

Once you have `obtained a license <https://www.graylog.org/enterprise/>`_
you can import it into your Graylog setup by going through the following steps.

#. As an admin user, open the System / License page from the menu in the web interface.
#. Click the Import new license button in the top right hand corner.
#. Copy the license text from the confirmation email and paste it into the text field.
#. The license should be valid and a preview of your license details should appear below the text field.
#. Click Import to activate the license.

The license automatically applies to all nodes in your cluster without the need to restart your server nodes.

.. note:: If there are errors, please check that you copied the entire license from the email without line breaks.
          The same license is also attached as a text file in case it is wrongly formatted in the email.

License Verification
====================

Some Graylog licenses require to check their validity on a regular basis. This includes the free Graylog Enterprise license with a specific amount of traffic included. 

If your network environment requires Graylog to use a proxy server in order to communicate with the external services via HTTPS, you'll have to configure the proxy server in the :ref:`Graylog configuration file<http_config>`. 

The Graylog web interface shows all details about the license, but if you are still unclear about the requirements, please contact our `sales team <https://www.graylog.org/contact-sales>`_ with your questions.
