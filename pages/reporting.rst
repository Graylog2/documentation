The Reporting feature enables you to create and customize your own reports by
using dashboard widgets, schedule reports to be automatically delivered to
the people who require them, and manually send or download reports as PDF
files at any time.

Additionally we also offer you historic information of report delivery, so you
can verify that the scheduled reporting deliveries are working as expected.

.. note:: Reporting is a commercial feature and part of `Graylog Enterprise <https://www.graylog.org/enterprise>`_.
