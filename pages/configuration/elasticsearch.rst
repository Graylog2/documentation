Elasticsearch
*************

We strongly recommend to use a dedicated Elasticsearch cluster for your Graylog setup.

If you are using a shared Elasticsearch setup, a problem with indices unrelated to Graylog might turn the cluster status to YELLOW or RED and impact the availability and performance of your Graylog setup.


Elasticsearch versions
======================

Starting with version 2.3, Graylog uses the HTTP protocol to connect to your Elasticsearch cluster, so it does not have a hard requirement for the Elasticsearch version anymore. We can safely assume that any version starting from 2.x is working.


===============  =====================
Graylog version  Elasticsearch version
===============  =====================
1.2.0-1.2.1      1.7.1
1.3.0-1.3.3      1.7.3
1.3.4            1.7.5
2.0.0            2.3.1
2.0.1-2.0.3      2.3.2
2.1.0-2.1.3      2.3.5
2.2.0-2.2.3      2.4.4
2.3.x-2.4.x      2.4.x, 5.6.x
2.5.x            2.4.x, 5.6.x, 6.8.x
3.0-3.1          5.6.x, 6.8.x
===============  =====================

.. caution:: Graylog 3.x **does not** work with Elasticsearch 7.x!
.. note:: Graylog works fine with the `Amazon Elasticsearch Service <https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/>`_ using Elasticsearch 5 or 6.
.. note:: Graylog works fine with the `Elastic Cloud <https://cloud.elastic.co>`_ using Elasticsearch 5 or 6.


Configuration
=============

.. caution:: As Graylog has switched from an embedded Elasticsearch node client to a lightweight HTTP client in version 2.3, please check the :ref:`upgrade notes <upgrade-from-22-to-23>` how to migrate your configuration if you are switching from an earlier version.

Graylog
-------

The most important setting to make a successful connection is a list of comma-separated URIs to one or more Elasticsearch nodes. Graylog needs to know the address of at least one other Elasticsearch node given in the ``elasticsearch_hosts`` setting. The specified value should at least contain the scheme (``http://`` for unencrypted, ``https://`` for encrypted connections), the hostname or IP and the port of the HTTP listener (which is ``9200`` unless otherwise configured) of this node. Optionally, you can also specify an authentication section containing a user name and a password, if either your Elasticsearch node uses `Shield/X-Pack <https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/security>`_ or `Search Guard <http://floragunn.com/searchguard/>`_, or you have an intermediate HTTP proxy requiring authentication in between the Graylog server and the Elasticsearch node. Additionally you can specify an optional path prefix at the end of the URI.

A sample specification of ``elasticsearch_hosts`` could look like this::

  elasticsearch_hosts = http://es-node-1.example.org:9200/foo,https://someuser:somepassword@es-node-2.example.org:19200

.. caution:: Graylog assumes that all nodes in the cluster are running the same versions of Elasticsearch. While it might work when patch-levels differ, we highly encourage to keep versions consistent.

.. warning:: Graylog does not react to externally triggered index changes (creating/closing/reopening/deleting an index) anymore. All of these actions need to be performed through the Graylog REST API in order to retain index consistency.

Available Elasticsearch configuration tunables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following configuration options are now being used to configure connectivity to Elasticsearch:

+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

.. _automatic_node_discovery:

Automatic node discovery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. caution:: Authentication with the Elasticsearch cluster will not work if the automatic node discovery is being used.

.. caution:: Automatic node discovery does not work when using the `Amazon Elasticsearch Service <https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/>`_ because Amazon blocks certain Elasticsearch API endpoints.

Graylog uses automatic node discovery to gather a list of all available Elasticsearch nodes in the cluster at runtime and distribute requests among them to potentially increase performance and availability. To enable this feature, you need to set the ``elasticsearch_discovery_enabled`` to ``true``. Optionally, you can define the a filter allowing to selectively include/exclude discovered nodes (details how to specify node filters are found in the `Elasticsearch cluster documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/cluster.html#cluster-nodes>`_) using the ``elasticsearch_discovery_filter`` setting, or tuning the frequency of the node discovery using the ``elasticsearch_discovery_frequency`` configuration option.

Configuration of Elasticsearch nodes
------------------------------------

.. _secure_es:

Control access to Elasticsearch ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are not using `Shield/X-Pack <https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/security>`_ or `Search Guard <http://floragunn.com/searchguard/>`_ to authenticate access to your Elasticsearch nodes, make sure to restrict access to the Elasticsearch ports (default: 9200/tcp and 9300/tcp). Otherwise the data is readable by anyone who has access to the machine over network.

Open file limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because Elasticsearch has to keep a lot of files open simultaneously it requires a higher open file limit that the usual operating
system defaults allow. **Set it to at least 64000 open file descriptors.**

Graylog will show a notification in the web interface when there is a node in the Elasticsearch cluster which has a too low open file limit.

Read about how to raise the open file limit in the corresponding `5.x <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/setup-configuration.html#file-descriptors>`__ / `6.x <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/file-descriptors.html>`__ documentation pages.

Heap size
^^^^^^^^^

It is strongly recommended to raise the standard size of heap memory allocated to Elasticsearch. Just set the ``ES_HEAP_SIZE`` environment
variable to for example ``24g`` to allocate 24GB. We recommend to use around 50% of the available system memory for Elasticsearch (when
running on a dedicated host) to leave enough space for the system caches that Elasticsearch uses a lot. But please take care that you `don't cross 32 GB! <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/heap-sizing.html#compressed_oops>`__

Merge throttling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 As of ES 6.2 Merge Throttling settings have been deprecated. (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/breaking_60_settings_changes.html)

Elasticsearch is throttling the merging of Lucene segments to allow extremely fast searches. This throttling however has default values
that are very conservative and can lead to slow ingestion rates when used with Graylog. You would see the message journal growing without
a real indication of CPU or memory stress on the Elasticsearch nodes. It usually goes along with Elasticsearch INFO log messages like this::

  now throttling indexing

When running on fast IO like SSDs or a SAN we recommend to increase the value of the ``indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec`` in your
``elasticsearch.yml`` to 150MB::

  indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec: 150mb

Play around with this setting until you reach the best performance.

Tuning Elasticsearch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graylog is already setting specific configuration for every index it is managing. This is enough tuning for a lot of use cases and setups.

More detailed information about the configuration of Elasticsearch can be found in the `official documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/system-config.html>`__.


Avoiding split-brain and shard shuffling
========================================

Split-brain events
------------------

Elasticsearch sacrifices consistency in order to ensure availability, and partition tolerance. The reasoning behind that is that short periods of misbehaviour are less problematic than short periods of unavailability. In other words, when Elasticsearch nodes in a cluster are unable to replicate changes to data, they will keep serving applications such as Graylog. When the nodes are able to replicate their data, they will attempt to converge the replicas and to achieve *eventual consistency*.

Elasticsearch tackles the previous by electing master nodes, which are in charge of database operations such as creating new indices, moving shards around the cluster nodes, and so forth. Master nodes coordinate their actions actively with others, ensuring that the data can be converged by non-masters. The cluster nodes that are not master nodes are not allowed to make changes that would break the cluster.

The previous mechanism can in some circumstances fail, causing a **split-brain event**. When an Elasticsearch cluster is split into two sides, both thinking they are the master, data consistency is lost as the masters work independently on the data. As a result the nodes will respond differently to same queries. This is considered a catastrophic event, because the data from two masters can not be rejoined automatically, and it takes quite a bit of manual work to remedy the situation.

Avoiding split-brain events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Elasticsearch nodes take a simple majority vote over who is master. If the majority agrees that they are the master, then most likely the disconnected minority has also come to conclusion that they can not be the master, and everything is just fine. This mechanism requires at least 3 nodes to work reliably however, because one or two nodes can not form a majority.

The minimum amount of master nodes required to elect a master must be configured manually in ``elasticsearch.yml``::

  # At least NODES/2+1 on clusters with NODES > 2, where NODES is the number of master nodes in the cluster
  discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2

The configuration values should typically for example:

+--------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Master nodes | minimum_master_nodes   | Comments                                                             |
+==============+========================+======================================================================+
| 1            | 1                      |                                                                      |
+--------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2            | 1                      | With 2 the other node going down would stop the cluster from working!|
+--------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3            | 2                      |                                                                      |
+--------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4            | 3                      |                                                                      |
+--------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5            | 3                      |                                                                      |
+--------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6            | 4                      |                                                                      |
+--------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Some of the master nodes may be *dedicated master nodes*, meaning they are configured just to handle lightweight operational (cluster management) responsibilities. They will not handle or store any of the cluster's data. The function of such nodes is similar to so called *witness servers* on other database products, and setting them up on dedicated witness sites will greatly reduce the chance of Elasticsearch cluster instability.

A dedicated master node has the following configuration in ``elasticsearch.yml``::

 node.data: false
 node.master: true

Shard shuffling
---------------

When cluster status changes, for example because of node restarts or availability issues, Elasticsearch will start automatically rebalancing the data in the cluster. The cluster works on making sure that the amount of shards and replicas will conform to the cluster configuration. This is a problem if the status changes are just temporary. Moving shards and replicas around in the cluster takes considerable amount of resources, and should be done only when necessary.

Avoiding unnecessary shuffling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Elasticsearch has couple configuration options, which are designed to allow short times of unavailability before starting the recovery process with shard shuffling. There are 3 settings that may be configured in ``elasticsearch.yml``::

  # Recover only after the given number of nodes have joined the cluster. Can be seen as "minimum number of nodes to attempt recovery at all".
  gateway.recover_after_nodes: 8
  # Time to wait for additional nodes after recover_after_nodes is met.
  gateway.recover_after_time: 5m
  # Inform ElasticSearch how many nodes form a full cluster. If this number is met, start up immediately.
  gateway.expected_nodes: 10

The configuration options should be set up so that only *minimal* node unavailability is tolerated. For example server restarts are common, and should be done in managed manner. The logic is that if you lose large part of your cluster, you probably should start re-shuffling the shards and replicas without tolerating the situation.


Custom index mappings
=====================

Sometimes it's useful to not rely on Elasticsearch's `dynamic mapping <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/dynamic-mapping.html>`__ but to define a stricter schema for messages.

.. note:: If the index mapping is conflicting with the actual message to be sent to Elasticsearch, indexing that message will fail.

Graylog itself is using a default mapping which includes settings for the ``timestamp``, ``message``, ``full_message``, and ``source`` fields of indexed messages::

  $ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200/_template/graylog-internal?pretty'
  {
  "graylog-internal" : {
    "order" : -1,
    "index_patterns" : [
      "graylog_*"
    ],
    "settings" : {
      "index" : {
        "analysis" : {
          "analyzer" : {
            "analyzer_keyword" : {
              "filter" : "lowercase",
              "tokenizer" : "keyword"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "mappings" : {
      "message" : {
        "_source" : {
          "enabled" : true
        },
        "dynamic_templates" : [
          {
            "internal_fields" : {
              "mapping" : {
                "type" : "keyword"
              },
              "match_mapping_type" : "string",
              "match" : "gl2_*"
            }
          },
          {
            "store_generic" : {
              "mapping" : {
                "type" : "keyword"
              },
              "match_mapping_type" : "string"
            }
          }
        ],
        "properties" : {
          "gl2_processing_timestamp" : {
            "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS",
            "type" : "date"
          },
          "gl2_accounted_message_size" : {
            "type" : "long"
          },
          "gl2_receive_timestamp" : {
            "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS",
            "type" : "date"
          },
          "full_message" : {
            "fielddata" : false,
            "analyzer" : "standard",
            "type" : "text"
          },
          "streams" : {
            "type" : "keyword"
          },
          "source" : {
            "fielddata" : true,
            "analyzer" : "analyzer_keyword",
            "type" : "text"
          },
          "message" : {
            "fielddata" : false,
            "analyzer" : "standard",
            "type" : "text"
          },
          "timestamp" : {
            "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS",
            "type" : "date"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "aliases" : { }
  }


In order to extend the default mapping of Elasticsearch and Graylog, you can create one or more custom index mappings and add them as index templates to Elasticsearch.

Let's say we have a schema for our data like the following:

======================  ==========  ========================
Field Name              Field Type  Example
======================  ==========  ========================
``http_method``         keyword     GET
``http_response_code``  long        200
``ingest_time``         date        2016-06-13T15:00:51.927Z
``took_ms``             long        56
======================  ==========  ========================

This would translate to the following additional index mapping in Elasticsearch::

  "mappings" : {
    "message" : {
      "properties" : {
        "http_method" : {
          "type" : "keyword"
        },
        "http_response_code" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "ingest_time" : {
          "type" : "date",
          "format": "strict_date_time"
        },
        "took_ms" : {
          "type" : "long"
        }
      }
    }
  }

The format of the ``ingest_time`` field is described in the Elasticsearch documentation about the `format mapping parameter <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/mapping-date-format.html>`_. Also make sure to check the Elasticsearch documentation about `Field datatypes <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/mapping-types.html>`_.

In order to apply the additional index mapping when Graylog creates a new index in Elasticsearch, it has to be added to an `index template <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/indices-templates.html>`_. The Graylog default template (``graylog-internal``) has the lowest priority and will be merged with the custom index template by Elasticsearch.

.. warning:: If the default index mapping and the custom index mapping cannot be merged (e. g. because of conflicting field datatypes), Elasticsearch will throw an exception and won't create the index. So be extremely cautious and conservative about the custom index mappings!

Creating a new index template
-----------------------------

Save the following index template for the custom index mapping into a file named ``graylog-custom-mapping.json``::

  {
    "template": "graylog_*",
    "mappings" : {
      "message" : {
        "properties" : {
          "http_method" : {
            "type" : "keyword"
          },
          "http_response_code" : {
            "type" : "long"
          },
          "ingest_time" : {
            "type" : "date",
            "format": "strict_date_time"
          },
          "took_ms" : {
            "type" : "long"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }


Finally, load the index mapping into Elasticsearch with the following command::

  $ curl -X PUT -d @'graylog-custom-mapping.json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://localhost:9200/_template/graylog-custom-mapping?pretty'
  {
    "acknowledged" : true
  }


Every Elasticsearch index created from that time on, will have an index mapping consisting of the original ``graylog-internal`` index template and the new ``graylog-custom-mapping`` template::

  $ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200/graylog_deflector/_mapping?pretty'
  {
    "graylog_3" : {
      "mappings" : {
        "message" : {
          "dynamic_templates" : [ 
            {
              "internal_fields" : {
                "match" : "gl2_*",
                "match_mapping_type" : "string",
                "mapping" : {
                  "type" : "keyword"
                }
              }
            }, 
            {
              "store_generic" : {
                "match_mapping_type" : "string",
                "mapping" : {
                  "type" : "keyword"
                }
              }
            }
          ],

          "properties" : {
            "full_message" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "analyzer" : "standard"
            },
            "http_method" : {
              "type" : "keyword"
            },
            "http_response_code" : {
              "type" : "long"
            },
            "ingest_time" : {
              "type" : "date",
              "format" : "strict_date_time"
            },
            "message" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "analyzer" : "standard"
            },
            "source" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "analyzer" : "analyzer_keyword",
              "fielddata" : true

            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

.. note:: When using different index sets every index set can have its own mapping.


Deleting custom index templates
-------------------------------

If you want to remove an existing index template from Elasticsearch, simply issue a ``DELETE`` request to Elasticsearch::

  $ curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:9200/_template/graylog-custom-mapping?pretty'
  {
    "acknowledged" : true
  }


After you've removed the index template, new indices will only have the original index mapping::

  $ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200/graylog_deflector/_mapping?pretty'
  {
    "graylog_3" : {
      "mappings" : {
        "message" : {
          "dynamic_templates" : [ 
            {
              "internal_fields" : {
                "match" : "gl2_*",
                "match_mapping_type" : "string",
                "mapping" : {
                  "type" : "keyword"
                }
              }
            }, 
            {
              "store_generic" : {
                "match_mapping_type" : "string",
                "mapping" : {
                  "type" : "keyword"
                }
              }
            }
          ],

          "properties" : {
            "full_message" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "analyzer" : "standard"
            },
            "message" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "analyzer" : "standard"
            },
            "source" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "analyzer" : "analyzer_keyword",
              "fielddata" : true
            },
            "streams" : {
              "type" : "keyword"
            },
            "timestamp" : {
              "type" : "date",
              "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

.. _rotate_es_indices:

.. note:: Settings and index mappings in templates are only applied to new indices. After adding, modifying, or deleting an index template, you have to manually rotate the write-active indices of your index sets for the changes to take effect.

Rotate indices manually
-----------------------

Select the desired index set on the ``System / Indices`` page in the Graylog web interface by clicking on the name of the index set, then select "Rotate active write index" from the "Maintenance" dropdown menu.

.. _es_cluster_status:

Cluster Status explained
========================

Elasticsearch provides a classification for the `cluster health <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/cluster-health.html>`_.

The cluster status applies to different levels:

* **Shard level** - see status descriptions below
* **Index level** - inherits the status of the worst shard status
* **Cluster level** - inherits the status of the worst index status

That means that the Elasticsearch cluster status can turn red if a single index or shard has problems even though the rest of the indices/shards are okay.

.. note:: Graylog checks the status of the current write index while indexing messages. If that one is GREEN or YELLOW, Graylog will continue to write messages into Elasticsearch regardless of the overall cluster status.

Explanation of the different status levels:

RED
---

The RED status indicates that some or all of the primary shards are not available.

In this state, no searches can be performed until all primary shards have been restored.


YELLOW
------

The YELLOW status means that all of the primary shards are available but some or all shard replicas are not.

When the index configuration include replication with a count that is equal or higher than the number of nodes, your cluster cannot become green. In most cases, this can be solved by adding another Elasticsearch node to the cluster or by reducing the replication factor of the indices.


GREEN
-----

The cluster is fully operational. All primary and replica shards are available.
