Connect to the Web Console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a browser and navigate to the URL ``http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9000``, substituting the IP of your graylog server. You should see a Graylog login page similar to the screenshot below.  

If using the VM appliance, log in using ``admin`` for both the username and password. If using either container or OS versions of Graylog, log in as admin and use the password from which you derived the password secret when installing Graylog.

Logging in will get you to a "Getting Started" screen.  But, if you are reading this, then you've already found the "Getting Started Guide", so just keep going.

Also, feel free to dismiss the guide or keep it for later.
