After that, you should see the Syslog UDP input appear on the screen.

Click *Show received messages* button on this screen, and you should have messages at the bottom. It may take a few minutes before you have messages coming in.

BOOM! Now that you have messages coming in, this is where the fun starts.

*Skip the next section if you are all good.*

If You Don't Have Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1.  Check to see that you made the proper entries in the rsyslog configuration file.

2.  Check the syslog UDP configuration and make sure that is right - remember we changed the default port to 5140.

3.  Check to see if rsyslog messages are being forwarded to the port.  You can use the `tcpdump <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/tcpdump.8.html>`_ command to do this:

``$ sudo tcpdump -i lo host 127.0.0.1 and udp port 5140``

4.  Check to see if the server is listening on the host:

``$ sudo netstat -peanut | grep ":5140"``
