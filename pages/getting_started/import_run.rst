Import the VM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These screenshots are for VMWare (VirtualBox is nearly the same).
Select *File -> Import...*, choose the ``graylog.ova`` file you downloaded, and follow the prompts.

Start VM
^^^^^^^^

This is what you'll see when you run the virtual machine.  This is where all the Graylog server processes (more on that later) and the database will run.  We can split them apart later for performance, but there's no need to do that right now for a quick overview.  Don't close this window just yet, we're going to need the IP for the next step.

The above steps are also covered in our :ref:`virtual machine appliance installation page <virtual-machine-appliances>` with some additional information.
