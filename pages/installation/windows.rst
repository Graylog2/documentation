Unfortunately there is no supported way to run Graylog on Microsoft
Windows operating systems even though all parts run on the Java Virtual
Machine. We recommend to run the :ref:`virtual machine appliances
<virtual-machine-appliances>`  on a Windows host. It should be technically
possible to run Graylog on Windows but it is most probably not worth the time
to work your way around the cliffs.

Should you require running Graylog on Windows, you need to disable the message
journal in ``graylog-server`` by changing the following setting in the
``graylog.conf``::

  message_journal_enabled = false

Due to restrictions of how Windows handles file locking the journal will not
work correctly.

**Please note that this impacts Graylog's ability to buffer messages, so we
strongly recommend running the Linux-based OVAs on Windows.**
