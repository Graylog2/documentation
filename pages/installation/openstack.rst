Installation
------------

Download the Graylog image from the `package <https://packages.graylog2.org/appliances/qcow2>`_ site, uncompress it and import it into the Openstack image store::

  $ wget https://packages.graylog2.org/releases/graylog-omnibus/qcow2/graylog-2.1.0-1.qcow2.gz
  $ gunzip graylog-2.1.0-1.qcow2.gz
  $ glance image-create --name='graylog' --is-public=true --container-format=bare --disk-format=qcow2 --file graylog-2.1.0-1.qcow2

You should now see an image called `graylog` in the Openstack web interface under `Images`

Usage
-----

Launch a new instance of the image, make sure to reserve at least 4GB ram for the instance. After spinning up, login with
the username `ubuntu` and your selected ssh key. Run the reconfigure program in order to setup Graylog and start all services::

  $ ssh ubuntu@<vm IP>
  $ sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure

Open `http://<vm ip>` in your browser to access the Graylog web interface. Default username and password is `admin`.

Basic configuration
===================

We are shipping the ``graylog-ctl`` tool with the virtual machine appliances to get you started
with a customised setup as quickly as possible. Run these (optional) commands to configure the
most basic settings of Graylog in the appliance::

  sudo graylog-ctl set-email-config <smtp server> [--port=<smtp port> --user=<username> --password=<password>]
  sudo graylog-ctl set-admin-password <password>
  sudo graylog-ctl set-timezone <zone acronym>
  sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure

The ``graylog-ctl`` has much more :ref:`functionality <graylog-ctl>` documented.
We strongly recommend to learn more about it to ensure smooth operation of your virtual appliance.

Production readiness
====================

You can use the Graylog appliances (OVA, Docker, AWS, ...) for small production setups but please consider to harden the security of the box before.

 * Set another password for the default ubuntu user
 * Disable remote password logins in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and deploy proper ssh keys
 * Seperate the box network-wise from the outside, otherwise Elasticsearch can be reached by anyone
 * add additional RAM to the appliance and raise the :ref:`java heap  <raise_java_heap>`!
 * add additional HDD to the appliance and :ref:`extend disk space <extend_ova_disk>`.
 * add the appliance to your monitoring and metric systems.

If you want to create your own customised setup take a look at our :ref:`other installation methods <installing>`.
