Select your `AMI and Availability Zone (AZ) <https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-images/tree/2.1/aws>`_.

Usage
-----

  * Click on *Launch instance* for your AWS region to start Graylog into.
  * Choose an instance type **with at least 4GB memory**.
  * Finish the wizard and spin up the VM.
  * Login to the instance via SSH as user `ubuntu`.
  * Run `sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure`.
  * Open port 80 and 9000 in the applied security group to access the web interface.
  * additionally open more ports for ingesting log data, like 514 for syslog or 12201 for the GELF protocol.

Open `http://<private ip>` in your browser to access the Graylog web interface. Default username and password is `admin`.

Networking
----------

Your browser needs access to port 80 or 443 for reaching the web interface. The interface itself creates a connection
back to the REST API of the Graylog server on port 9000. As long as you are in a private network like Amazon VPC for
instance, this works out of the box.
If you want to use the *public* IP address of your VM, this mechanism doesn't work automatically anymore. You have
to tell Graylog how to reach the API from the users browser perspective::

  sudo graylog-ctl set-external-ip http://<public ip>:9000/api/
  sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure

Also make sure that this port is open, even on the public IP.

HTTPS
-----

In order to enable HTTPS for the web interface both ports need to be encrypted. Otherwise the web browser would show
an error message. For this reason we created a proxy configuration on the appliance that can be enabled by running::

  sudo graylog-ctl enforce-ssl
  sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure

This command combines the Graylog web interface and the API on port 443. The API is accessable via the path `/api`.
For this reason you have to set the external IP to an HTTPS address with the appended path `/api`::

  sudo graylog-ctl set-external-ip https://<public ip>:443/api
  sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure

Basic configuration
-------------------

We are shipping the ``graylog-ctl`` tool with the virtual machine appliances to get you started
with a customised setup as quickly as possible. Run these (optional) commands to configure the
most basic settings of Graylog in the appliance::

  sudo graylog-ctl set-email-config <smtp server> [--port=<smtp port> --user=<username> --password=<password>]
  sudo graylog-ctl set-admin-password <password>
  sudo graylog-ctl set-timezone <zone acronym>
  sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure

The ``graylog-ctl`` has much more :ref:`functionality documented <graylog-ctl>`.
We strongly recommend to learn more about it to ensure smooth operation of your virtual appliance.

Production readiness
====================

You can use the Graylog appliances (OVA, Docker, AWS, ...) for small production setups but please consider to harden the security of the box before.

 * Set another password for the default ubuntu user
 * Disable remote password logins in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and deploy proper ssh keys
 * Seperate the box network-wise from the outside, otherwise Elasticsearch and MongoDB can be reached by anyone
 * add additional RAM to the appliance and raise the :ref:`java heap  <raise_java_heap>`!
 * add additional HDD to the appliance and :ref:`extend disk space <extend_ova_disk>`.
 * add the appliance to your monitoring and metric systems.

If you want to create your own customised setup take a look at our :ref:`other installation methods <installing>`.
