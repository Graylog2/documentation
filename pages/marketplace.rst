Graylog Marketplace
*******************

The `Graylog Marketplace <http://marketplace.graylog.org>`_ is the central directory of add-ons for Graylog. It contains plugins, content packs, GELF libraries and more content built by Graylog developers and community members.

GitHub integration
==================

The Marketplace is deeply integrated with GitHub. You sign-in with your GitHub
account if you want to submit content and only have to select an existing
repository to list on the Marketplace.

From there on you manage your releases and code changes in GitHub. The Marketplace
will automatically update your content.

There is no need to sign-in if you only want to browse or download content.

General best practices
======================

.. _mpreadme:

README content
--------------

We kindly ask you to provide an as descriptive as possible ``README`` file with your
submission. This
file will be displayed on the Marketplace detail page and should provide the following
information:

* What is it.
* Why would you want to use it? (Use cases)
* Do you have to register somewhere to get for example an API token?
* How to install and configure it.
* How to use it in a Graylog context.

Take a look at the `Splunk plug-in <https://marketplace.graylog.org/addons/974efcc3-8d78-4847-becd-0f26821d2646>`_
as an example.

The README supports `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown>`_
for formatting. You cannot submit content that does not contain a ``README`` file.

.. _mplicense:

License
-------

You cannot submit content that does not contain a ``LICENSE`` or ``COPYING`` file.
We recommend to consult `ChooseALicense.com <http://choosealicense.com>`_ if you are
unsure which license to use.

4 Types of Add-Ons
==================

Plug-Ins: Code that extends Graylog to support a specific use case that it doesnâ€™t support out of the box.

Content Pack: A file that can be uploaded into your Graylog system that sets up streams, inputs, extractors, dashboards, etc. to support a given log source or use case.

GELF Library: A library for a programming language or logging framework that supports sending log messages in GELF format for easy integration and pre-structured messages.

Other Solutions: Any other content or guide that helps you integrate Graylog with an external system or device. For example, how to configure a specific device to support a format Graylog understands out of the box.

Contributing plug-ins
=====================

You :ref:`created a Graylog plugin <plugins>` and want to list it in the
Marketplace? This is great. Here are the simple steps to follow:

#. Create a GitHub repository for your plugin
#. Include a :ref:`README <mpreadme>` and a :ref:`LICENSE <mplicense>` file in
   the repository.
#. Push all your code to the repository.
#. `Create a GitHub release <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/>`_
   and give it the name of the plugin version. For example ``0.1``. The
   Marketplace will always show and link the latest version. You can upload
   as many release artifacts as you want here. For example the ``.jar`` file
   together with ``DEB`` and ``RPM`` files. The Marketplace will link to the
   detail page of a release for downloads.
#. Submit the repository to the Marketplace

Contributing content packs
==========================

Graylog content packs can be shared on the Marketplace by following these steps:

#. Export a Graylog content pack from the Graylog Web Interface and save the
   generated JSON in a file called ``content_pack.json``.
#. Create a GitHub repository for your content pack
#. Include a :ref:`README <mpreadme>` and a :ref:`LICENSE <mplicense>` file in
   the repository.
#. Include the ``content_pack.json`` file in the root of your GitHub repository.
#. Submit the repository to the Marketplace

Contributing GELF libraries
===========================

A GELF library can be added like this:

#. Create a GitHub repository for your GELF library.
#. Include a :ref:`README <mpreadme>` and a :ref:`LICENSE <mplicense>` file in
   the repository.
#. Describe where to download and how to use the GELF library in the ``README``.

Contributing other content
==========================

You want to contribute content that does not really fit into the other categories
but describes how to integrate a certain system or make it send messages to Graylog?

This is how you can do it:

#. Create a GitHub repository for your content
#. Include a :ref:`README <mpreadme>` and a :ref:`LICENSE <mplicense>` file in
   the repository.
#. All content goes into the ``README``.
