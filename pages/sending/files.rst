Ingest from files
******************

Log files come in many different flavors and formats, much more than any single program could handle.

That is why Graylog does not collect files directly but uses a wide range of collectors and agents specially made for this.
The collectors can be configured and controlled by the already available configuration management software in the environment, our  :ref:`Graylog Sidecar <graylog-sidecar>` that needs to be installed and configured, or manually.

Of course, you can still use any program supporting the GELF or Syslog protocol (among others) to send your logs to Graylog.

The most recommended way to pick a log file from Windows or Linux systems is `filebeat <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-overview.html>`__. This collector is build to collect log files and ship them to a central location. The output module in filebeat is called logstash needed to send messages to a Graylog beats input. 


A basic filebeat configuration for filebeat on Linux can look like the following::

			fields_under_root: true
			fields.collector_node_id: ${sidecar.nodeName}
			fields.gl2_source_collector: ${sidecar.nodeId}

			filebeat.inputs:
			- input_type: log
			  paths:
			    - /var/log/*.log
			  type: log
			output.logstash:
			   hosts: ["graylog:5044"]
			path:
			  data: /var/lib/graylog-sidecar/collectors/filebeat/data
			  logs: /var/lib/graylog-sidecar/collectors/filebeat/log


For Windows, the basic filebeat configuration can be like::

			fields_under_root: true
			fields.collector_node_id: ${sidecar.nodeName}
			fields.gl2_source_collector: ${sidecar.nodeId}

			output.logstash:
			   hosts: ["graylog:5044"]
			path:
			  data: C:\Program Files\Graylog\sidecar\cache\filebeat\data
			  logs: C:\Program Files\Graylog\sidecar\logs
			tags:
			 - windows
			filebeat.inputs:
			  type: log
			  enabled: true
			  paths:
			    - C:\logs\log.log
