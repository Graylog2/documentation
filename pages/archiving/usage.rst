Creating Archives
=================

There are three ways to create archives from the Graylog Elasticsearch
indices.

* :ref:`Web Interface <archive-create-web-interface>`
* :ref:`Index Retention <archive-create-index-retention>`
* :ref:`REST API <archive-create-rest-api>`

.. _archive-create-web-interface:

Web Interface
-------------

You can manually create an archive on the "System/Archives" page in the
web interface.

.. image:: /images/archiving-usage-create-web.png

On the "Create Archive for Index" section of the page is a form where you
can select an index and archive it by pressing "Archive Index".

Using this will just archive the index to disk and does not close it or
delete it. This is a greate way to test the archiving feature without
changing your :ref:`index retention configuration <archive-config-index-retention>`.

.. _archive-create-index-retention:

Index Retention
---------------

The archive plugin ships with an index retention strategy that can be used
to automatically create archives before closing or deleting Elasticsearch
indices.

This is the easiest way to automatically create archives without custom
scripting.

Please see the :ref:`Index Retention Configuration <archive-config-index-retention>`
on how to configure it.

.. _archive-create-rest-api:

REST API
--------

The archive plugin also offers a REST API that you can use to automate archive
creation if you have some special requirements and need a more flexible way to
do this.

.. image:: /images/archiving-usage-create-api.png

An index can be archived with a simple curl command::

   $ curl -s -u admin -X POST http://127.0.0.1:12900/plugins/org.graylog.plugins.archive/archives/graylog_386
   Enter host password for user 'admin': ***************
   {
      "archive_job_config" : {
        "archive_path" : "/tmp/graylog-archive",
        "max_segment_size" : 524288000,
        "segment_filename_prefix" : "archive-segment",
        "metadata_filename" : "archive-metadata.json",
        "source_histogram_bucket_size" : 86400000,
        "restore_index_batch_size" : 1001
      },
      "system_job" : {
        "id" : "cd7ebfa0-079b-11e6-9e1b-fa163e6e9b8a",
        "description" : "Archives indices and deletes them",
        "name" : "org.graylog.plugins.archive.job.ArchiveCreateSystemJob",
        "info" : "Archiving documents in index: graylog_386",
        "node_id" : "c5df7bff-cafd-4546-ac0a-5ccd2ba4c847",
        "started_at" : "2016-04-21T08:34:03.034Z",
        "percent_complete" : 0,
        "provides_progress" : true,
        "is_cancelable" : true
      }
    }

That command started a system job in the Graylog server to create an archive
for index ``graylog_386``. The ``system_job.id`` can be used to check the
progress of the job.

The REST API can be used to automate other archive related tasks as well, like
restoring and deleting archives or updating the archive config. See the 
REST API browser on your Graylog server for details.

Restoring Archives
==================

.. note:: The restore process adds load to your Elasticsearch cluster because
          all messages are basically **re-indexed**. Please make sure to keep
          this in mind and test with smaller archives to see how your cluster
          behaves. Also use the :ref:`Restore Index Batch Size <archive-config-option-restore-batch-size>`
          setting to control the Elasticsearch batch size on re-index.

The archive plugin offer two ways to restore archived indices.

* :ref:`Web Interface <archive-restore-web-interface>`
* :ref:`REST API <archive-restore-rest-api>`

A restored index has a ``_restored_archive`` in the index name to avoid
conflicts with the original index. (if that still exists)

.. image:: /images/archiving-usage-restore-web-result.png

Restored indices are also marked as ``reopened`` so they are **ignored** by
index retention jobs and are not closed or deleted. That means you have to
manually delete any restored indices **manually** once you do not need them
anymore.

.. _archive-restore-web-interface:

Web Interface
-------------

In the web interface you can restore an archive on the "System/Archives" page
by selecting an archive from the list, open the archive details and clicking
the "Restore Index" button.

.. image:: /images/archiving-usage-restore-web.png

.. _archive-restore-rest-api:

REST API
--------

As with archive creation you can also use the REST API to restore an
archived index into the Elasticsearch cluster::

   $ curl -s -u admin -X POST http://127.0.0.1:12900/plugins/org.graylog.plugins.archive/archives/graylog_386/restore
   Enter host password for user 'admin': ***************
   {
      "archive_metadata": {
        "index_name": "graylog_307",
        "document_count": 491906,
        "created_at": "2016-04-14T14:31:50.787Z",

          },
          "inputs": {

            "56fbafe0fb121a5309cef28d": "nginx access_log"
          },
          "nodes": {
            "c5df7bff-cafd-4546-ac0a-5ccd2ba4c847": "graylog.example.org"
          }
        },
        "source_histogram": {
          "2016-04-14T00:00:00.000Z": {
            "example.org": 227567
          }
        },
        "segments": [
          {
            "path": "archive-segment-0.gz",
            "size": 21653755
          }
        ]
      },
      "system_job": {
        "id": "e680dcc0-07a2-11e6-9e1b-fa163e6e9b8a",
        "description": "Restores an index from the archive",
        "name": "org.graylog.plugins.archive.job.ArchiveRestoreSystemJob",
        "info": "Restoring documents from archived index: graylog_307",
        "node_id": "c5df7bff-cafd-4546-ac0a-5ccd2ba4c847",
        "started_at": "2016-04-21T09:24:51.468Z",
        "percent_complete": 0,
        "provides_progress": true,
        "is_cancelable": true
      }
    }

The returned JSON payload contains the archive metadata and the system job
description that runs the index restore process.

Restore into a separate cluster
-------------------------------

As said earlier, restoring archived indices slow down your indexing speed
because of added load. If you want to completely avoid adding more load to
your Elasticsearch cluster, you can restore the archived indices on a
different cluster.

To do that, you only have to transfer the archived indices to a different
machine and put them into the configured :ref:`Archive Path <archive-config-option-archive-path>`.

Each index archive is in a separate directory, so if you only want to transfer
one index to a different machine, you only have to copy the corresponding
directory into the archive path.

Example::

  $ tree /tmp/graylog-archive
    /tmp/graylog-archive
    ├── graylog_171
    │   ├── archive-metadata.json
    │   └── archive-segment-0.gz
    ├── graylog_201
    │   ├── archive-metadata.json
    │   └── archive-segment-0.gz
    ├── graylog_268
    │   ├── archive-metadata.json
    │   └── archive-segment-0.gz
    ├── graylog_293
    │   ├── archive-metadata.json
    │   └── archive-segment-0.gz
    ├── graylog_307
    │   ├── archive-metadata.json
    │   └── archive-segment-0.gz
    ├── graylog_386
    │   ├── archive-metadata.json
    │   └── archive-segment-0.gz
    └── graylog_81
        ├── archive-metadata.json
        └── archive-segment-0.gz
    7 directories, 14 files

Searching in Restored Indices
=============================

Once an index has been restored from an archive it will be used by search
queries automatically.

Every message that gets restored into an Elasticsearch index gets a special
``gl2_archive_restored`` field with value ``true``. This allows you to only
search in restored messages by using a query like::

    _exists_:gl2_archive_restored AND <your search query>

Example:

.. image:: /images/archiving-usage-search.png

If you want to exclude all restored messages from you query you can use::

    _missing_:gl2_archive_restored AND <your search query>
