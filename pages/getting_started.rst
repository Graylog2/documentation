To make it easy to take your first look at Graylog we provide a :ref:`virtual appliance <virtual-machine-appliances>`, which may be ran using VMware, VirtualBox, etc. After deploying the virtual appliance, the pages in this section will help introduce you to Graylog.

After you feel comfortable working with Graylog you should make a fresh :ref:`installation <installing>` that addresses your unique needs, such as sizing and security. The virtual appliance is only intended to showcase Graylog's features, and should not be ran in production.

If you need assistance planning and building your logging environment `we offer professional support <https://www.graylog.org/professional-support>`__ that can work with you.
