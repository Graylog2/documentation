Getting Started
***************

This guide is designed for first time users and is intended to give enough key information to get Graylog installed and configured initially. Each section links to additional details on the topic.

Graylog is a very flexible solution. It can be deployed in many different ways. For those who would like to do an initial lab evaluation of Graylog, we recommend starting with the virtual machine appliances. 

Virtual Appliances are the fastest way to get started. However, since the Virtual Appliances are generally not suitable for use in production, **they should be used strictly for proof of concept, evaluations or lab environments**. Users should plan to pick one of the other, more flexible installation methods for a production deployment.

If you need assistance planning and building your logging environment `we offer professional support <https://www.graylog.org/professional-support>`__ that can work with you.
