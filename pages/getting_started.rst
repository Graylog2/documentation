To get the first look what Graylog is and how you can work with we have a :ref:`virtual appliance <virtual-machine-appliances>` to run on VMWare or Virtualbox. The following will guide you to start using Graylog.

After you feel omfortable you should make a fresh :ref:`installation <installing>` that takes care of youre recommendation regarding the sizing and the security settings. The virtual appliance is only created to have a showcase about the features and is not created to run in production.

If you need assistance to plan and build your logging environment `we offer professional support <https://www.graylog.org/professional-support>`__ that can work with you.
